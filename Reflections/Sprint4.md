# Sprint 4 Reflection

## Procedural things:

### Start

* Reviewing pull requests more quickly to prevent them from sitting in the queue for multiple days
* Deleting branches when they have been merged and are no longer needed

### Stop

* Committing temp files, files that only change build paths, etc.
* Leaving Trello cards un-updated, as it can make it difficult to know what has been completed, reviewed, or needs to be done

### Continue

* Using GitHub for version control and code review
* Using Trello to keep track of who is doing which tasks and what still needs to be done
* Using Discord to communicate
* Having weekly/semi-weekly meetings
* Making frequent pull requests to make master up to date

## Code things:

### Start/More

* Better organization of files within folders
* Cleaning up older files that are either obsolete or need updates to logic

## Stop/Avoid

* Magic numbers
* Tight coupling
* Long, repetitive logic
