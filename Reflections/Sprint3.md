# Sprint 3 Reflection

## Procedural things:

### Start

* Doing more work sooner in the sprint

* Communicating more often to see how much is left, who is working on what, etc.

### Stop

* Having multiple branches working on the same class, leading to many conflicts when attempting to merge into master

* Making large branches with a lot of new things in them, leading to needing to work around that branch for future work

* Committing files where only build paths were changed (i.e. .mgcontent files)

### Continue

* Using Trello to keep track of tasks, Discord for communication, and Github for version control/code review

## Code things:

### Start/More

* Folders for organization of different parts of the project

* Refactoring code that has difficult-to-follow logic, repeated code, etc.

## Stop/Avoid

* Tight coupling in some classes, which causes multiple things to be fixed if just one thing is changed

* Hard-coding things like coordinates, as it makes it difficult to change the function of certain things
