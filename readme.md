Levels
---

Included within the project files is a namespace called 'Levels'. This namespace is responsible for organizing
the game's dungeon into rooms. The primary fixture of the 'Levels' namespace is the Map class. The Map class
handles the connection and drawing of all rooms as well as what is spawned within them. First, this section will
dive deeper into the 'Map' and the method by which the game stores this pertinent information. Secondly, this section
will further discuss 'Rooms' that the Map creates and by what means those are stored.

Map
---
[See `Updated Map` for changes]<br/>
As mentioned before, the map handles the connection and drawing of all rooms. Please refer to Figures 1 & 2 for complete
reference to the explanation. In short, there exists a 'Map.csv' file that, in each row, describes a room by a unique, three 
digit ID and the room connections above, below, left, right, and via stairs to it. This forms a complete Map layout where every
room is a row within the CSV file. Please see `Figure 1` for the notes for the Map.csv creation. For rooms that do not have a connection
to another room via the 5 connection options (up, down, left, right, stairs), a '-1' is present at that particular entry within the CSV.
For details on particular room IDs, see `Figure 2` which shows each room in the dungeon with the corresponding ID as it appears within
Map.csv. With the connections of each room settled within Map, the 'currentRoom' is what is drawn on screen. The next section will 
elaborate on Rooms similarly to how this section highlighted the Map.

Room
---
Like the map, every Room's content and visuals are stored within a CSV file. Unlike the map, however, there is a unique CSV file for each
unique room ID. Every CSV is named after what room it represents. For example, the room with the id = "002" has a corresponding CSV file named
"002.csv". Within those CSV files, there is a general structure that the files adhere to. As seen in `Figure 3`, the roomID.csv files must have the
tag on the first line "ROOM_"id where id is the unique three digit string that corresponds to the room. On the following lines of the file, there
will be a desired object types to spawn (valid classes to spawn are found implementing either IObstacle, INpc, or IWorldItem) using its exact namespace
followed by comma seperated integer values which serve as the x-coordinate and y-coordinate that indicate where to spawn the desired object. Please
see `Figure 3` for full notes and an example on a simple room CSV file.

Updated Map
---
During Sprint 4, locked doors & keys were introduced into Map.csv. While no positional rules have changed within the CSV file, the unique, three digit room identifiers are now suffixed by a terminal bit that identifies whether or not that room connection has a locked door.
- For example:
    - RoomID: "0010" is a connection to room 001 with an unlocked door
    - RoomID: "0011" is a connection to room 001 with a locked door

Known Bugs
---
This section of the file will enumerate the most intrusive, found bugs in the game.

- Enemies knockback into walls
    - When an enemy recieves damage and is knocked back into a wall, the enemy has a chance of flying behind the wall, trapping them out of the screen.

- Sound bugs
    - Though there are a few bugs of this nature, the most intrusive were found when the player holds a button and repeats an action. This causes the sound file to play on loop and overlap itself.

Intentional Ommisions
---
In an attempt to keep scope under control and meet deadlines, the team made the decision to make several omissions while developing the game. This section highlights the biggest of those decisions.

- Side scrolling dungeon where bow is retrieved was omitted

- A couple of enemy types omitted

- Bombs blowing up walls omitted

- Mission hints from the "Old Man" omitted

- Pushable blocks omitted
